Reuters Tesla TSLA O plans to push global production of its top selling Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles sharply higher in the fourth quarter and build on that growth in 2023 as newer factories in Austin and Berlin ramp production internal plans reviewed by Reuters show.Tesla is production forecast if achieved would put the EV maker on track to meet Elon Musk is goal for production in the coming quarter and put the automaker close to the scale of German luxury automaker BMW BMWG DE by end 2023.Musk and Tesla have a record of pointing to stretch targets the company has not always met.In April for instance Musk had said Tesla could hit 60 growth in deliveries.By July the company had walked that target back to 50 for this year.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters com Register The ambitious goal came despite lingering supply chain risks a slowing economy and rising competition and falling Tesla order backlogs.But its forecast which covers the next four consecutive quarters sets an ambitious target to produce almost 495 000 Model Y and Model 3s in the fourth quarter of this year.Those two models account for about 95 of Tesla s output.The production plans would see Tesla blow past projected growth in the global market for autos by close to a factor of 10 in 2023 with a production increase of over 50 for the year.Reuters confirmed the global output target for the Model Y and Model 3 with two people with knowledge of its projections.They spoke on condition they would not be named because the forecast is private.Tesla did not immediately respond with a comment.And Tesla is expansion has been expensive.In late May Musk had said new factories in Texas and Germany were losing billions of dollars comparing them to gigantic money furnaces.Tesla is expected to announce third quarter deliveries and output as early as Saturday.That is forecast to show the automaker bounced back sharply from the slowdown in the previous quarter when output in Shanghai had been hit by COVID 19 control measures.Brokerage Piper Sandler projects Tesla will deliver 354 000 vehicles in the third quarter.Citi expects deliveries of 369 800 vehicles.Troy Teslike a

the fourth quarter than other quarters of the year going back to 2018.Its forecast production of 1 59 million Model Y and Model 3s through the first three quarters of next year would put it on track

2021 the most recent full year of comparable sales.That output would also be just past the forecast of Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives who has been bullish on Tesla is prospects.Ives forecasts 2023 deliveries of 2 million EVs in 2023 up from 1 39 million this year.Musk Tesla s CEO and product architect told analysts last quarter the company had a good chance of hitting a global production run rate of 40 000 vehicles a week by the end of 2022.The internal forecast detailed to Reuters would assume Tesla can hit and maintain that production through the first quarter.The forecast also hinges on a sharp gain in output in Tesla is newer factories in Austin Texas and Berlin.Production in Austin would jump to almost 101 000 by the end of the third quarter 2023.For Berlin the equivalent gain would be from 51 000 next quarter to almost 90 000 by the quarter ending September 2023.Joerg Steinbach the regional economy minister of Brandenburg where Tesla has its factory near Berlin has said Tesla would be moving to three shifts at the plant by the end of the year.Sam Fiorani vice president of global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions AFS which tracks production said it would not be a surprise to see big jumps in output for Tesla from plants in Austin and Berlin since those plants have been running below capacity.Berlin and Austin are coming into their own next year and that s where a lot of this volume is coming from he said.But he said his baseline forecast did not put Tesla at over 2 million vehicles for 2023.We do not have them at that level yet he said.It seems very optimistic Fiorani added The industry as a whole is still struggling with supply chain issues The Tesla forecast also includes an assumption that production in Shanghai a mega factory that accounted for over half of its output in the first half of this year will level off over the course of 2023.Tesla recently upgraded the factory is capacity.Sources told Reuters earlier this week the plan was to run production at 20 500 vehicles a week for the remainder of the year.The projected growth in Tesla is output also faces economic risks an issue Musk himself has raised before.Global growth has slowed sharply especially in China the world is largest EV market where Tesla faces fast growing rivals.German industrial production faces uncertainties in coming months over the availability of gas

effort to develop the product over a decade or more the most detailed vision he has provided to date on a business he has said could be bigger than Tesla is EV revenue.Tesla is push to design and

leader in fields like artificial intelligence not just a company that makes cool cars.An experimental test robot that Tesla said was developed in February walked out to wave at the crowd on Friday and Tesla showed a video of it doing simple tasks such as watering plants carrying boxes and lifting metal bars at a production station at the company is California plant.But a more streamlined current one which Musk said was closer to what he hoped to put into production had to be rolled out on a platform and did a slow wave to the crowd.Musk called it Optimus and said it would be able to walk in a few weeks.There is still a lot of work to be done to refine Optimus and prove it Musk said adding later I think Optimus is going to be incredible in five or 10 years like mind blowing.He said existing humanoid robots are missing a brain and the ability to solve problems on their own.By contrast he said Optimus would be an extremely capable robot that Tesla would aim to produce in the millions.Other automakers including Toyota Motor 7203 T and Honda Motor 7267 T have developed humanoid robot prototypes capable of doing complicated things like shooting a basketball and production robots from ABB and others are a mainstay of auto manufacturing.But Tesla is alone in pushing the market opportunity for a mass market robot that could also be used in factory work.The next generation Tesla bot will

Musk has described the event as intended to recruit workers and the engineers on stage catered to a technical audience.They detailed the process by which Tesla designed robot hands and used crash simulator technology to test the robot s ability to fall on its face without breaking.Musk who has spoken before about the risks of artificial intelligence said the mass rollout of robots had the potential to transform civilization and create a future of abundance a future of no poverty But he said he believed it was important that Tesla shareholders had a role in vetting the company s efforts.If I go crazy you can fire me Musk said.This is important Many reactions on Twitter were positive focusing on the speed of Tesla is development effort since August last year when Tesla announced its project with a stunt that had a person in a white suit simulate a humanoid robot.Henri Ben Amor a robotics professor at Arizona State University said Musk is price target of 20 000 was a good proposition since current costs are about 100 000 for humanoid robots.There is some discrepancy between sort of the ambition and what they have presented he said.When it comes to dexterity speed the ability to walk in a stable fashion and so on there is still a lot of work to be done.Aaron Johnson a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University also said the robot is need was debatable.What is really impressive is that they got to that level so quickly.What is still a little murky is what exactly the use case is for them to make millions of these Johnson said.Tesla also discussed its long delayed self driving technology at the event.Engineers working on the auto self driving software described how they trained software to choose actions such as when to merge into traffic and how they sped up the computer decision making process.In May Musk said that the world is most valuable car maker would be worth basically zero without achieving full self driving

original terms if the Delaware judge stayed the proceedings.A source familiar with Twitter is team told Reuters that at a court hearing on Tuesday morning the judge requested the two sides report back in the evening.It was not immediately clear why Musk chose to abandon his fight although some pointed to his scheduled deposition.He was about to get deposed and a lot of uncomfortable facts were going to come out said Eric Talley a professor at Columbia Law School.Twitter received Musk is letter and intended to close the deal at the original price a spokesperson told Reuters.Twitter did not say whether it accepted Musk is offer.Musk one of Twitter is most prominent users said in July he could walk away without penalty because the number of bot accounts was much higher than Twitter is estimate of less than 5 of users.Bots are automated accounts and their use can lead to overestimations of how many humans are on the service which is important for advertising rates and the overall value of the service.Twitter is legal team on Sept 27 said that scientists employed by Musk estimated the number of fake accounts on the platform at 5 3 and 11.None of these analyses so far as we can

professor at UC Berkeley.Musk realized he said in all likelihood it was going to result in forcing him to close at 54 20 a share.Musk was relatively quiet on Twitter during the day but late on Tuesday he tweeted that Twitter probably accelerates X by 3 to 5 years.That echoed suggestions he made to Twitter staff in June about creating a super app or marketplace for different apps and features like WeChat which is popular in China.Musk also has said he wants to create a money transfer feature.FINANCING A settlement between the two sides would revive fears among Twitter is users about Musk is plans for the platform which has removed prominent politically conservative voices.Supporters of Donald Trump hope that Musk will reactivate the account of the former U S president who was banned after the Jan 6 2021 attack on the U S Capitol by his supporters.Musk has used Twitter to stir controversy including on Monday when he floated a peace plan for the Ukraine Russia war that drew swift condemnation from Ukraine is president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.Bloomberg was the first to report Musk was willing to pay the original price.Musk also said his offer was contingent on stopping the legal proceedings.A settlement at the original price would also allow Musk to finance the transaction without any complications.If Musk and Twitter had renegotiated the price it would have technically allowed committed backers to walk away.Musk has already sold 15 4 billion worth of Tesla shares since agreeing to buy Twitter.Musk has also secured a financing commitment from banks including Morgan Stanley Bank of America Corp Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 8306 T and Barclays Plc BARC L to provide a 12 5 billion margin loan to support his Twitter acquisition.The banks that agreed to finance the acquisition are likely to lose hundreds of millions of dollars on the deal because they would struggle to attract investors to buy the debt given the downturn in markets since the deal was signed.However the banks agreed to provide the financing irrespective of whether they can sell the loans and face long legal odds freeing themselves from the financing commitment according to regulatory filings.Since Twitter has already received shareholder support for the sale to Musk the deal could close quickly in the coming weeks if the two sides were to settle on the original

{"text": "Oct 5 Reuters Car haulers are pushing the Biden administration and lawmakers to increase truck weight limits on U S highways so they can transport more heavy electric vehicles a move fiercely opposed by the rail industry and safety advocates who say the heavier loads are significantly more dangerous.Even before a recent spike in EV sales U S roads have been carrying heavier loads as cars and trucks climbed from an average of 3 200 pounds 1 451 kilos to 4 200 pounds over the last four decades according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Electric vehicles with their heavy batteries weigh significantly more than gas fueled cars.While they make up less than 1 of cars on U S roads President Joe Biden wants EVs to reach half of vehicle sales by 2030 and he and his Democratic Party have put billions in federal funds behind the goal.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters com Register Car haulers the pipeline of the auto industry move thousands of cars each day from factory parking lots ports and rail yards to dealers often using open double decker trailers.If decades old U S road weight limits are not increased it could slow deliveries and increase costs putting at risk this historic bet on zero emission vehicles they say.The truth is we will not be able move as many electric vehicles under the current weight limit.That could mean more trucks on the road delays in orders and increased costs said Sarah Amico executive chairman of Jack Cooper among the largest car haulers in North America.Individual trailers are currently restricted by federal highway safety standards dating to 1975 to 80 000 pounds gross vehicle weight including a truck and trailer that can account for half of the limit.In recent months the car hauling industry has stepped up lobbying efforts with lawmakers on key committees and officials at the Department of Transportation Commerce and the White House National Economic Council interviews with industry and administration officials show.They have pled their case in face to face meetings letters and round tables.However the move is firmly opposed by their rivals in the freight rail industry and safety experts who warn heavier vehicles are harder to stop easier to roll and result in more wear and tear on roads and bridges.This is the latest effort by the trucking industry to leverage a political situation like growing interest in EVs to push for higher weight limits something motorists oppose says Cathy Chase President of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.With any incremental change comes incremental danger and that results in more fatalities Chase said.U S traffic fatality rates are higher than Europe and deaths have jumped since the pandemic to nearly 43 000 people a year.CONGRESS NOT BIDEN WILL DECIDE The U S Department of Transportation declined to say whether it supports or opposes lifting weight limits on car haulers noting the ultimate decision lies with Congress Congressional committees overseeing transportation said they have yet to take a position on the issue.However Rodney Davis a Republican lawmaker from Illinois who serves on the House Transportation Committee and is ranking member on the highway subcommittee says he is working to increase weight limits.The auto transporter industry needs a modest 5 to 10 weight variance.Otherwise an already challenged supply chain will require more tractor trailer rigs on the nation s highways to deliver the same number of finished vehicles.That means more miles driven more wear and tear on our roads more fuel used and more emissions Davis said.The American Trucking Associations has asked lawmakers to increase the weight limit by 10 to 88 000 pounds saying the current weight limit is unsustainable given the trends.That extra 8 000 pounds could allow car haulers to carry the same number of EVs as traditional cars Ford s new F 150 Lightning all electric pickup truck weighs about 1 600 pounds more than its gas powered F 150 counterpart.Similarly the all electric Volvo XC40 Recharge SUV weighs about 1 000 pounds more than a gas powered Volvo XC40.Hyundai Motor and Kia sold twice as many EVs in the U S in the first seven months of this year than all of 2021 sales for market leader Tesla are also outpacing last year.Reuters Graphics One industry idea is higher weights for up to 300 miles.Haulers often unload a car by then putting them under the 80 000 pound limit.California which just passed a law banning sales of gasoline powered cars by 2035 read more has done essentially that increasing weight limits for trucks carrying goods in and out of its ports to ease supply chain bottlenecks and clear containers off the docks of Los Angeles and Long Beach.Temporary permits starting in November of last year lift weight restrictions for trucks to 88 000 pounds.The state has not researched whether increasing the weight limits helped ease congestion or posed a safety risk.The

huge losses on their commitment to finance the 44 billion buyout of Twitter Inc TWTR N may not be able to back out of the deal easily but they might have a way to minimize the hit they take.Morgan Stanley MS N Bank of America Corp BAC N Barclays Plc BARC L and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 8306 T led a 13 billion financing for the bid by Musk the world is richest man and chief executive of Tesla Inc TSLA O and SpaceX.Typically banks would sell the debt to investors and pocket an underwriting fee.But the terms of the financing were set in April when Musk first made an offer for Twitter and the market for such debt has collapsed since then.That means if banks tried to sell the debt now they would have to do so at a loss to entice investors to take it off their hands.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters com Register Banks could however try to minimize their losses by increasing the amount of debt that is secured by collateral so that it is less risky holding a bigger portion of it on their balance sheets and reducing the amount they have to sell to investors in the near term according to half a dozen debt capital market bankers and investors.Two people familiar with the thinking of the banking syndicate pointed to Wall Street is experience with the financing provided to fund the buyout of business software company Citrix Systems Inc CTXS MX as a possible model.In that case Wall Street firms ended up taking a loss of about 700 million after selling 8 55 billion of loans and bonds but averted an even bigger loss by tweaking the package the market sources and investors said.But they would need Musk s signoff for any rejig of the financing structure and there is no guarantee he would agree they said.Reuters could not determine whether banks had approached Musk with a proposal.Morgan Stanley Barclays MUFG Bank of America Societe Generale SOGN PA Mizuho and BNP Paribas BNPP PA declined to comment.Representatives for Musk and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.Elon Musk vs Twitter The debate currently a topic of conversation among investment bankers and debt investors provides a window into the havoc wreaked on Wall Street by Musk s U turn last week.After engaging in a weeks long court battle trying to get out of it Musk abruptly decided he would close on his deal on the original terms.Musk however conditioned his proposal on his ability to secure debt financing and now has until Oct 28 to close on the transaction.read more Roberta Goss head of bank loan and collateralized loan obligations platform for investment manager Pretium Partners said any financing is going to be a hard sell with investors because the amount of debt being put on is almost seven times Twitter s 2022 expected profits of 2 billion making it very risky.Musk would have the upper hand in any talks with the banks.It is currently out of the money for banks and in the money for Musk Goss said.VARIOUS OPTIONS The debt financing package is comprised of leveraged loans which are risky because of the amount of debt the company is taking on as well as secured and unsecured bonds.Any debt sale to a broad investor pool would require credit ratings from the top three rating agencies Moody is Investors Services S P and Fitch.Moody is senior analyst Neil Begley said banks have not yet approached his firm for such ratings.If the bank group are looking for a deal to syndicate they often pursue credit ratings because it acts like a passport to the debt capital markets but we have not heard from them as yet said Begley.Usually such ratings are sought two to three weeks before a debt sale to give the agencies time but Begley said a shorter turnaround was possible given his firm gave a Ba2 rating to Twitter when it last issued bonds in February.Begley said the fact that banks had not reached out to them so far could also be a sign they were thinking of holding on to the debt until the markets improve.If the debt commitments are really hard wired here then banks may have to consider delaying debt syndication plans if the market has no appetite for highly levered transactions so it wouldn t make sense to come and see us with urgency he said.PACKAGE TWEAK Banks could hold more debt on their books by converting some unsecured debt into second lien loans or loans secured by a pledge of collateral and look to sell a bigger portion of Term Loan A is TLA several high yield bankers and investors said.TLA is considered to be a relatively safer category of debt that is held by the lenders themselves.In September banks financing the Citrix buyout undertook a similar restructuring.They averted bigger losses by adding a TLA component to the package according to one of the sources who is familiar with the Citrix deal.The banks also sold a smaller portion of Term Loan B is a riskier class of debt to institutional investors and converted nearly 4 billion of the package to a second lien loan that was held on their books as they waited for more favorable market conditions the source said.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters com Register Reporting by Shankar Ramakrishnan in New York and Krystal

{"text": "NEW YORK Oct 6 Reuters Breakingviews Imagine if instead of buying Twitter TWTR N Elon Musk had decided to spend 44 billion on purchasing a bank.His investment would have been vetted by regulators who would ask questions about his track record his assets and liabilities and his funding.From then on Musk would have to make sure his bank had enough capital and was responsive to customers complaints.Its internal processes would be pored over regularly by examiners.Buying banks is hard.Buying Twitter has been hard too because Musk made an offer and tried to go back on it.But in regulatory terms it should be a walk in the park.For the agencies that oversee takeovers the only question is whether Musk s ownership of the social network concentrates the market in a way that harms consumers it clearly doesn t or whether owning Twitter will unfairly benefit his other businesses like carmaker Tesla TSLA O or satellite firm SpaceX which it likely won t.Buying Twitter is financially onerous too but compared with buying a bank it s pretty simple stuff.The reason for the difference seems obvious at first.Banks are complicated and risky and when they get into trouble it can quickly become a public problem.They create money and shepherd capital so without them there s no commerce.Moreover American banks are tied to regulators from birth.To exist they must have a charter from a state or federal agency and the quid pro quo is that they re subject to elaborate controls and investigations when they want to merge or be acquired.Social media companies conversely are a place where people tweet poop emojis and exchange cat GIFs.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters com Register If ever there were a case for rethinking this mentality it s Musk s decision to buy Twitter.The social media firm might not manage money but like a bank it could cause broad social or economic harm if it finds itself in the hands of an irresponsible owner.Twitter reaches around one fifth of the U S population or roughly 60 million people.The brainchild of Jack Dorsey like Meta Platforms s META O Instagram and messaging apps like Snap SNAP N and TikTok has a direct line into young America s mental state.Adolescents on average spend 7 7 hours a day in front of screens for non academic activities.Musk may be as responsible an owner of Twitter as anyone but there s no vetting process taxed with finding out.The Trump administration in attempting to ban TikTok on the grounds of it being owned by Chinese firm ByteDance cited its role in disinformation campaigns that appeared to benefit Beijing.Yet TikTok was in the crosshairs because it is not U S owned.There s no law that prevents Twitter or Facebook from being used in disinformation campaigns by a bad actor say.Internet firms are regulated when it comes to privacy or false advertising but they aren t generally liable when it comes to content.There are other issues.Musk himself does not have the same national security concerns as a Chinese buyer but he does have close ties with Beijing.China is the second biggest market for Tesla in which over 100 billion of his wealth is tied up.Musk has also said he will make a unilateral decision to put former U S President Donald Trump back on the platform if he is the owner.That s as arbitrary as Twitter s decision to boot Trump off perhaps.But neither decision offers comfort when considering the amount of influence such platforms have.Congress isn t blind to the legal vacuum in which large social media companies operate.Several politicians have challenged the piece of legislation known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that shields companies from liability for content that their users post.But even if the protections the act affords were removed that could only make stewardship of online content more lax since a technology firm could potentially sidestep liability by just deciding to forgo moderating altogether.The idea that change of ownership has consequences for people other than shareholders and in areas other than banking isn t new.After what is now Kraft Heinz KHC O bought UK confectioner Cadbury in 2010 and closed down a key factory Britain changed its takeover rules to force bidders to explain their plans for employees up front.There s also precedent for setting a bar on what kind of buyer is acceptable.Britain s financial conduct regulators demand honesty integrity and reputation.Broadcasters must be fit and proper None of that applies to social media in the United States.And it s not likely to.A divided Congress has so far found it impossible to legislate on the issue and the activities of technology firms tend to provoke even more political discord than other kinds of business.But while politicians squabble social media continues to shape society in ways that may only become apparent years later.There s no free market for controlling banks because if they re mismanaged it becomes everyone s problem.It s not obvious why social media firms should be so different.Follow johnsfoley on Twitter The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.The opinions

{"text": "Sept 28 Reuters Some major advertisers including Dyson Mazda Forbes and PBS Kids have suspended their marketing campaigns or removed their ads from parts of Twitter because their promotions appeared alongside tweets soliciting child pornography the companies told Reuters.DIRECTV and Thoughtworks also told Reuters late on Wednesday they have paused their advertising on Twitter.Brands ranging from Walt Disney Co DIS N NBCUniversal CMCSA O and Coca Cola Co KO N to a children is hospital were among more than 30 advertisers that appeared on the profile pages of Twitter accounts peddling links to the exploitative material according to a Reuters review of accounts identified in new research about child sex abuse online from cybersecurity group Ghost Data.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters com Register Some of tweets include key words related to rape and teens and appeared alongside promoted tweets from corporate advertisers the Reuters review found.In one example a promoted tweet for shoe and accessories brand Cole Haan appeared next to a tweet in which a user said they were trading teen child content.We are horrified David Maddocks brand president at Cole Haan told Reuters after being notified that the company is ads appeared alongside such tweets.Either Twitter is going to fix this or we will fix it by any means we can which includes not buying Twitter ads.In another example a user tweeted searching for content of Yung girls ONLY NO Boys which was immediately followed by a promoted tweet for Texas based Scottish Rite Children is Hospital.Scottish Rite did not return multiple requests for comment.In a statement Twitter spokesperson Celeste Carswell said the company has zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation and is investing more resources dedicated to child safety including hiring for new positions to write policy and implement solutions.She added that Twitter is working closely with its advertising clients and partners to investigate and take steps to prevent the situation from happening again.Twitter is challenges in identifying child abuse content were first reported in an investigation by tech news site The Verge in late August.The emerging pushback from advertisers that are critical to Twitter is revenue stream is reported here by Reuters for the first time.Like all social media platforms Twitter bans depictions of child sexual exploitation which are illegal in most countries.But it permits adult content generally and is home to a thriving exchange of pornographic imagery which comprises about 13 of all content on Twitter according to an internal company document seen by Reuters.Twitter declined to comment on the volume of adult content on the platform.Ghost Data identified the more than 500 accounts that openly shared or requested child sexual abuse material over a 20 day period this month.Twitter failed to remove more than 70 of the accounts during the study period according to the group which shared the findings exclusively with Reuters.Reuters could not independently confirm the accuracy of Ghost Data is finding in full but reviewed dozens of accounts that remained online and were soliciting materials for 13 and young looking nudes.After Reuters shared a sample of 20 accounts with Twitter last Thursday the company removed about 300 additional accounts from the network but more than 100 others still remained on the site the following day according to Ghost Data and a Reuters review.Reuters then on Monday shared the full list of more than 500 accounts after it was furnished by Ghost Data which Twitter reviewed and permanently suspended for violating its rules said Twitter is Carswell on Tuesday.In an email to advertisers on Wednesday morning ahead of the publication of this story Twitter said it discovered that ads were running within Profiles that were involved with publicly selling or soliciting child sexual abuse material.Andrea Stroppa the founder of Ghost Data said the study was an attempt to assess Twitter is ability to remove the material.He said he personally funded the research after receiving a tip about the topic.Twitter is transparency reports on its website show it suspended more than 1 million accounts last year for child sexual exploitation.It made about 87 000 reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children a government funded non profit that facilitates information sharing with law enforcement according to that organization is annual report.Twitter needs to fix this problem ASAP and until they do we are going to cease any further paid activity on Twitter said a spokesperson for Forbes.There is no place for this type of content online a spokesperson for carmaker Mazda USA said in a statement to Reuters adding that in response the company is now prohibiting its ads from appearing on Twitter profile pages.A Disney spokesperson called the content reprehensible and said they are doubling down on our efforts to ensure that the digital platforms on which we advertise and the media buyers we use strengthen their efforts to prevent such errors from recurring.A spokesperson for Coca Cola which had a promoted tweet appear on an account tracked by the researchers said it did not condone the material being associated with its brand and said any breach of these standards is unacceptable and taken very seriously.NBCUniversal said it has asked Twitter to remove the ads associated with the inappropriate content.CODE WORDS Twitter is hardly alone in grappling with moderation failures related to child safety online.Child welfare advocates say the number of known child sexual abuse images has soared from thousands to tens of millions in recent years as predators have used social networks including Meta is Facebook and Instagram to groom victims and exchange explicit images.For the accounts identified by Ghost Data nearly all the traders of child sexual abuse material marketed the materials on Twitter then instructed buyers to reach them on messaging services such as Discord and Telegram in order to complete payment and receive the files which were stored on cloud storage services like New Zealand based Mega and U S based Dropbox according to the group is report.A Discord spokesperson said the company had banned one server and one user for violating its rules against sharing links or content that sexualize children.Mega said a link referenced in the Ghost Data report was created in early August and soon after deleted by the user which it declined to identify.Mega said it permanently closed the user is account two days later.Dropbox and Telegram said they use a variety of tools to moderate content but did not provide additional detail on how they would respond to the report.Still the reaction from advertisers poses a risk to Twitter is business which earns more than 90 of its revenue by selling digital advertising placements to brands seeking to market products to the service is 237 million daily active users.Twitter is also battling in court Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk who is attempting to back out of a 44 billion deal to buy the social media company over complaints about the prevalence of spam accounts and its impact on the business.A team of Twitter employees concluded in a report dated February 2021 that the company needed more investment to identify and remove child exploitation material at scale noting the company had a backlog of cases to review for possible reporting to law enforcement.While the amount of child sexual exploitation content has grown exponentially Twitter is investment in technologies to detect and manage the growth has not according to the report which was prepared by an internal team to provide an overview about the state of child exploitation material on Twitter and receive legal advice on the proposed strategies.Recent reports about Twitter provide an outdated moment in time glance at just one aspect of our work in this space and is not an accurate reflection of where we are today Carswell said.The traffickers often use code words such as cp for child pornography and are intentionally as vague as possible to avoid detection according to the internal documents.The more that Twitter cracks down on certain keywords the more that users are nudged to use obfuscated text which tend to be harder for Twitter to automate against the documents said.Ghost Data is Stroppa said that such tricks would complicate efforts to hunt down the materials but noted that his small team of five researchers and no access to Twitter is internal resources was able to find hundreds of accounts within 20 days.Twitter did not respond to a request for further comment.Register now for FREE unlimited
